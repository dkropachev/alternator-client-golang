# GoLang Alternator client

## Glossary

- Alternator.
An DynamoDB API implemented on top of ScyllaDB backend.  
Unlike AWS DynamoDBâ€™s single endpoint, Alternator is distributed across multiple nodes.
Could be deployed anywhere: locally, on AWS, on any cloud provider.

- Client-side load balancing.
A method where the client selects which server (node) to send requests to, 
rather than relying on a load balancing service.

- DynamoDB.
A managed NoSQL database service by AWS, typically accessed via a single regional endpoint.

- AWS Golang SDK.
The official AWS SDK for the Go programming language, used to interact with AWS services like DynamoDB.
Have two versions: [v1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go) and [v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2)

- DynamoDB/Alternator Endpoint.
The base URL a client connects to. 
In AWS DynamoDB, this is typically something like http://dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
In DynamoDB it is any of Alternator nodes

- Datacenter (DC).
A physical or logical grouping of racks.
On Scylla Cloud in regular setup it represents cloud provider region where nodes are deployed.

- Rack.
A logical grouping akin to an availability zone within a datacenter. 
On Scylla Cloud in regular setup it represents cloud provider availability zone where nodes are deployed.

## Introduction

This repo is a simple helper for AWS SDK, that allows seamlessly create a DynamoDB client that balance load across Alternator nodes.
There is a separate library every AWS SDK version:
- For [v1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go) - [sdkv1](sdkv1)
- For [v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2) - [sdkv2](sdkv2)

## Using the library

You create a regular `dynamodb.DynamoDB` client by one of the methods listed below and 
the rest of the application can use this dynamodb client normally
this `db` object is thread-safe and can be used from multiple threads.

This client will send requests to an Alternator nodes, instead of AWS DynamoDB.

Every request performed on patched session will pick a different live
Alternator node to send it to.
Connections to every node will be kept alive even if no requests are being sent.

### Rack and Datacenter awareness

You can configure load balancer to target particular datacenter (region) or rack (availability zone) via `WithRack` and `WithDatacenter` options, like so:
```golang
    lb, err := alb.NewHelper([]string{"x.x.x.x"}, alb.WithRack("someRack"), alb.WithDatacenter("someDc1"))
```

Additionally, you can check if alternator cluster know targeted rack/datacenter:
```golang
	if err := lb.CheckIfRackAndDatacenterSetCorrectly(); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("CheckIfRackAndDatacenterSetCorrectly() unexpectedly returned an error: %v", err)
	}
```

To check if cluster support datacenter/rack feature supported you can call `CheckIfRackDatacenterFeatureIsSupported`:
```golang
    supported, err := lb.CheckIfRackDatacenterFeatureIsSupported()
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to check if rack/dc feature is supported: %v", err)
	}
	if !supported {
        return fmt.Errorf("dc/rack feature is not supporte")	
    }
```

### Create DynamoDB client

```golang
import (
	"fmt"

    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/dynamodb/attributevalue"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/dynamodb"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/dynamodb/types"

    helper "github.com/scylladb/alternator-client-golang/sdkv2"
)

func main() {
    h, err := helper.NewHelper([]string{"x.x.x.x"}, helper.WithPort(9999), helper.WithCredentials("whatever", "secret"))
    if err != nil {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("failed to create alternator helper: %v", err))
    }
    ddb, err := h.NewDynamoDB()
    if err != nil {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("failed to create dynamodb client: %v", err))
    }
    _, _ = ddb.DeleteTable(...)
}
```

## Distinctive features

### Headers optimization

Alternator does not use all the headers that are normally used by DynamoDB.
So, it is possible to instruct client to delete unused http headers from the request to reduce network footprint.
Artificial testing showed that this technic can reduce outgoing traffic up to 56%, depending on workload and encryption.

It is supported only for AWS SDKv2, example how to enable it:
```go
    h, err := helper.NewHelper(
		[]string{"x.x.x.x"}, 
	    helper.WithPort(9999), 
		helper.WithCredentials("whatever", "secret"), 
		helper.WithOptimizeHeaders(true),
	)
    if err != nil {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("failed to create alternator helper: %v", err))
    }
```

### Decrypting TLS

Read wireshark wiki regarding decrypting TLS traffic: https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS#using-the-pre-master-secret
In order to obtain pre master key secrets, you need to provide a file writer into `alb.WithKeyLogWriter`, example:

```go
	keyWriter, err := os.OpenFile("/tmp/pre-master-key.log", os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
    if err != nil {
        panic("Error opening key writer: " + err.Error())
	}
	defer keyWriter.Close()
	lb, err := alb.NewHelper(knownNodes, alb.WithScheme("https"), alb.WithPort(httpsPort), alb.WithIgnoreServerCertificateError(true), alb.WithKeyLogWriter(keyWriter))
```

Then you need to configure your traffic analyzer to read pre master key secrets from this file.
